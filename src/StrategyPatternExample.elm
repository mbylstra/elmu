{- at it's most abstract, the break function does
  nothing more than transform the state of the car.
  This assumes a very simplistic model of breaking,
  where the break is applied will full force for
  a length of time that is undefined. Perhaps
  the lenght of time is assumed to be the lenght
  of one tick of the clock or maybe a millisecond.
  This type signature is the equivalent of the IBreakBehavior
  Interface in the Java example

  Let's imagine that the touchItem.force Web API has been implemented and browers

  applicatio can be used   ??? can it?
